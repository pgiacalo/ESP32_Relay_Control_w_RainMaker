## ðŸŽ¬ VIDEO SCRIPT

### **INTRO (0:00 - 0:30)**
**[Camera: Close-up of ESP32-C6 board]**
"Have you ever wished you could control your garage doors from anywhere in the world? Today, I'm going to show you how to build a professional-grade garage door opener using an ESP32-C6 and Espressif's RainMaker platform."

**[Camera: Wide shot showing complete setup]**
"This project gives you remote control of two garage doors through your smartphone, with enterprise-level security and reliability. Let's dive in!"

### **SECTION 1: PROJECT OVERVIEW (0:30 - 1:30)**
**[Camera: Split screen - ESP32 on left, smartphone app on right]**

**What This Project Does:**
- Controls two garage doors independently
- Works from anywhere via RainMaker cloud
- Provides 0.5-second pulse activation (just like physical buttons)
- Includes comprehensive safety features
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android)

**Key Benefits:**
- âœ… No monthly fees (unlike commercial solutions)
- âœ… Professional-grade security
- âœ… Open-source and customizable
- âœ… Works with existing garage door systems
- âœ… Battery backup ready with supercapacitor

### **SECTION 2: HARDWARE COMPONENTS (1:30 - 3:00)**
**[Camera: Close-up shots of each component]**

**Core Hardware:**
1. **ESP32-C6 Development Board** - The brains of the operation
   - Dual-core RISC-V processor
   - Built-in WiFi and Bluetooth
   - Low power consumption

2. **Dual-Channel Relay Module** - The interface to your garage doors
   - Normally open relays (fails safe)
   - 10A @ 120V AC rating
   - Electrical isolation for safety

3. **Power Supply Solution** - The secret to reliability
   - 5V DC power supply
   - 1.5F supercapacitor for stability
   - Prevents brownout resets during operation

**GPIO Configuration:**
- Door 1: GPIO 15
- Door 2: GPIO 19
- Compatible with ESP32, ESP32-C6, and ESP32-S3

---

### **SECTION 3: SAFETY FEATURES (3:00 - 4:00)**
**[Camera: Close-up of relay module and wiring]**

**Safety is Paramount:**
- **Normally Open Relays** - If power fails, relays open (doors stay closed)
- **Startup Protection** - GPIO pins set HIGH immediately on boot
- **Pulse Operation** - Only 0.5-second activation (prevents motor damage)
- **Electrical Isolation** - Relays provide complete isolation from garage door circuits
- **Supercapacitor Backup** - Maintains power during voltage drops

**Why This Matters:**
- No risk of doors opening unexpectedly
- No damage to garage door motors
- Safe for family use
- Meets professional safety standards

---

### **SECTION 4: SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE (4:00 - 5:30)**
**[Camera: Code snippets and block diagrams]**

**RainMaker Integration:**
- Cloud-based control via Espressif RainMaker
- MQTT communication for real-time control
- OTA (Over-The-Air) updates
- Local control fallback

**Key Software Features:**
- **Dual Device Support** - Each door is a separate RainMaker device
- **Momentary Button Behavior** - App buttons return to OFF after activation
- **State Management** - Accurate reporting of relay states
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error recovery
- **Logging** - Detailed operation logs for troubleshooting

**Security Features:**
- TLS encryption for all communications
- Certificate-based authentication
- No hardcoded credentials
- Secure provisioning process

---

### **SECTION 5: DEMONSTRATION (5:30 - 7:00)**
**[Camera: Live demonstration with smartphone and garage doors]**

**Setup Process:**
1. Power up the ESP32-C6
2. Open ESP RainMaker app
3. Scan QR code for provisioning
4. Enter WiFi credentials
5. Device connects to RainMaker cloud

**Live Demo:**
- Show app interface
- Demonstrate Door 1 activation
- Show 0.5-second pulse timing
- Demonstrate Door 2 activation
- Show both doors working independently
- Demonstrate app responsiveness

**Real-World Scenarios:**
- "I'm at work and need to let someone in"
- "I forgot to close the garage door"
- "I want to check if the doors are closed"

---

### **SECTION 6: TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (7:00 - 8:00)**
**[Camera: Technical diagrams and code highlights]**

**Power Management:**
- 300-500mA constant draw
- Supercapacitor handles current spikes
- Stable operation from external 5V supply
- No battery required for normal operation

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- iOS: Perfect operation, buttons return to OFF
- Android: Full functionality (minor UI quirk in detail view)
- Web interface available
- API access for custom integrations

**Reliability Features:**
- Auto-reconnection to WiFi
- MQTT keep-alive management
- Factory reset capability
- Comprehensive error logging
